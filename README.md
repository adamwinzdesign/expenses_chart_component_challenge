## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [React ChartJS](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/)

### What I learned

This was my first in-depth experience with ChartJS. I'm definitely looking forward to using this package again in another project, especially one that requires dynamic data fetching, rather than the hard-coded data used here.
